    <h1>Control Flow</h1>
    <h5>Control flow statements determine the order in which individual statements, 
      instructions, or function calls are executed or evaluated in a program.</h5>

    <h2>Conditional Statements</h2>
    <p>Conditional statements execute code blocks based on specified conditions.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>if</strong>: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.</li>
      <li><strong>if-else</strong>: Executes one block of code if a condition is true and another block if it is false.</li>
      <li><strong>switch</strong>: Selects one of many code blocks to execute based on the value of an expression.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Loops</h2>
    <p>Loops execute a block of code repeatedly based on a condition.</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>for</strong>: Loops through a block of code a specified number of times.</li>
      <li><strong>while</strong>: Loops through a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.</li>
      <li><strong>do-while</strong>: Executes a block of code once, and then repeats the loop as long as a specified condition is true.</li>
      <li><strong>foreach</strong>: Loops through each item in a collection or array.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Proper use of control flow statements is essential for creating efficient and logical programs in C#.</p>
